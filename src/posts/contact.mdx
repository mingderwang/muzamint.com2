  When we first met with Erik Pelletier, he was blunt. Recently hired as VP of Product Development, he told us that Technology Review needed a new digital strategy. He and his team had already laid the groundwork for change. They conducted an extensive reader survey that highlighted the organization’s strengths and weaknesses. All the key players were primed and ready for something new — but what?
</p>
<p>
  We worked closely with Erik and his team to create a cohesive digital content and product strategy that would answer the question for a multitude of stakeholders: Editors, writers, advertisers, sales, and — most important — readers. With help from analytics and user interviews, we honed in on the typical TR subscriber. They’re innovators and early adopters. Intelligent, highly educated business & technology leaders, most in a senior or executive role.
</p>
<p>
  Our creative brief, which triangulates Technology Review’s mission, audience, and digital goals, expanded on that insight.

    From the Creative Brief
  </h6>
  <p>
    Your typical reader tucks a supercomputer’s worth of processing power into their suit pocket everyday. With the ocean of information available in a single swipe, people need a guide who puts it all in context, points toward the future, and helps them make smarter choices in a digital world.
  </p>
  <p>
    In a recent audience survey, your readers praised you for doing just that. You’re the approachable expert who speaks with authority and clarity about the most important technical topics of the day. You’re not wonky like an academic journal or full of empty calories like a popular newsstand magazine. There is nobody better to provide an intelligent, lucid filter on the world of technology, everyday.

  Our redesign tightened that filter and embraced the goal of making Technology Review a daily destination. While innovation moves at a breakneck pace, the new website distills the day’s news into an easy-to-digest format. You can see the strategy in action on “The Daily,” a new editorial product we helped create (more on that later), and on the redesigned homepage, which you can see below.
